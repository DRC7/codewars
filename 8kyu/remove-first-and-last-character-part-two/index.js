// You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.

// Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character sequences except the first and the last ones but this time separated by spaces.

// If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting string to be empty, return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).

function array(arr) {
    return arr.split(',').slice(1, -1).join(' ') || null;
