// You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

// Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

// ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

// Note that you can receive floats as well.

//My Solution

const toNumberArray = stringArray => stringArray.map(Number)
